# Retail Sales SQL Analysis Project

## üìò Project Overview
This project involves building a SQL-based analytical system to explore and derive insights from a fictional retail sales dataset. The tasks include setting up the database, cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and solving real-world business problems through SQL queries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Database & Table Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

---

## üìä Data Exploration & Cleaning
```sql
-- View the dataset
SELECT * FROM retail_sales;

-- Check the total number of records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

-- Remove records with NULL values
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id IS NULL OR
    sale_date IS NULL OR
    sale_time IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR
    category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR
    price_per_unit IS NULL OR
    cogs IS NULL OR
    total_sale IS NULL;

-- Unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) FROM retail_sales;

-- Unique product categories
SELECT DISTINCT(category) FROM retail_sales;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND quantity >= 4 AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';
```

### 3. üì¶ Total Sales by Category

SELECT category, gender, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
```

### 6. üìÜ Best Selling Month Per Year
```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale FROM (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month
) AS t1
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

### 7. üèÜ Top 5 Customers by Sales

SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM (
    SELECT *,
           CASE
               WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
               WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
               ELSE 'Evening'

```

### 10. üè∑Ô∏è Top Selling Category per Month
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        category,

    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month, category
)
SELECT year, month, category, total_sale FROM cte WHERE rnk = 1;
```

### 11. üí∏ Classify Customers by Spending Tiers
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS purchase_value,
       CASE
           WHEN SUM(total_sale) > 10000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN SUM(total_sale) BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Mid'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS spending_tiers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Customers per Tier
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS purchase_value,
           CASE
               WHEN SUM(total_sale) > 10000 THEN 'High'
               WHEN SUM(total_sale) BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN 'Mid'

    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY category, hr
)
SELECT category, hr, total_transaction FROM cte WHERE rnk = 1;
```

### 13. üîÑ Q1 to Q4 Sales Growth by Category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) IN (1, 2, 3) THEN total_sale ELSE 0 END) AS Q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) IN (10, 11, 12) THEN total_sale ELSE 0 END) AS Q4_sales,
    ROUND((
        SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) IN (10, 11, 12) THEN total_sale ELSE 0 END) -
        SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) IN (1, 2, 3) THEN total_sale ELSE 0 END)
    ) / NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) IN (1, 2, 3) THEN total_sale ELSE 0 END), 0) * 100, 2) AS growth_percentage

        WHEN weekday(sale_date) = '2' THEN 'Tuesday'
        WHEN weekday(sale_date) = '3' THEN 'Wednesday'
        WHEN weekday(sale_date) = '4' THEN 'Thursday'
        WHEN weekday(sale_date) = '5' THEN 'Friday'
        WHEN weekday(sale_date) = '6' THEN 'Saturday'
    END AS day_of_week,
    AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY avg_sales DESC;

        ELSE '>50'
    END AS age_group,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
